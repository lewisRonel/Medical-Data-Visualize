# Medical-Data-Visualize
A freeCodeCamp data analysis project
## Context
In this project, I will visualize and make calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas. 
The dataset values were collected during medical examinations.
## Data description
The rows in the dataset represent patients and the columns represent information like body measurements, results from various blood tests, and lifestyle choices. I will use the dataset to explore the relationship between cardiac disease, body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices.
